# 📚 Python Basics: Complete Summary

---

## 🐍 What is Python?

✅ **Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language used for various applications such as:
- **Web Development:** Django, Flask
- **Data Science & AI:** NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow
- **Automation & Scripting:** Automate repetitive tasks
- **Game Development:** Pygame
- **Cybersecurity:** Security scripting

### ✨ Why Python is Popular:
1. **Easy to Learn:** Simple and readable syntax.
2. **Versatile:** Can be used for different types of applications.
3. **Large Community:** Extensive documentation and tutorials.
4. **Extensive Libraries:** Access to thousands of pre-built libraries.

### 📝 Basic Syntax Example:
```python
# Print a message
print("Hello, World!")

# Variables and Data Types
x = 5           # Integer
y = 3.14        # Float
name = "John"   # String

# Conditional Statement
if x > 2:
    print("x is greater than 2")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 2")
```

## 📚 Libraries vs. Frameworks

### 🔧 What is a Library?
- A collection of pre-written code that contains reusable functions.
- Allows developers to use existing solutions instead of writing code from scratch.

### 📝 Examples of Libraries:
1. **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr)
```
2. **Pandas:** For data manipulation.
```python
import pandas as pd
data = {"Name": ["John", "Alice", "Bob"], "Age": [25, 30, 22]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```

### 🏗️ What is a Framework?
- A collection of libraries and tools that provide structure for building applications.
- Defines the architecture and enforces best practices.

### 📝 Examples of Frameworks:
1. **Django:** For web applications.
2. **Flask:** For lightweight web applications.
```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

## 🧠 How Python Works: Behind the Scenes

### ⚙️ Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Write the Code (.py file):** You write Python code.
2. **Compilation (Bytecode Generation):** Python converts source code to bytecode.
3. **Interpretation (Bytecode Execution):** Python Virtual Machine (PVM) executes the bytecode.

### 🔥 Internal Workflow:
```
Source Code (.py) → Bytecode (.pyc) → PVM → Output
```

### 📝 Example:
```python
# Simple Python code
x = 5
y = 10
sum = x + y
print("Sum:", sum)
```

### 🎮 How to Run Python Code:
1. **Using Terminal:**
```bash
python hello.py
```
2. **Using IDE (VS Code, PyCharm):**
- Open the file and click **Run**.
3. **Using Jupyter Notebook:**
- Run code cell-by-cell interactively.
